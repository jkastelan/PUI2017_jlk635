### Assignment 1
For Assignment 1, I completed the three tasks related to MTA swipe data for 194 weeks.

#### Task 1 - Identifying extreme events

I plotted the 600 stations. There was an extreme drop in the number of swipes which appeared in October 2012. A Google search of event around this time revealed this was due to Hurricane Sandy.



#### Task 2 - Identifying trends

We are interested in identifying trends in ridership (by ticket type). First perform a statistical test of using the Dickey-Fuller tests for unit root.

Overall 15 ticket types are identified as non-stationary, and a difference in ridership proportion for the first 10 weeks and last 10 weeks is calculated. Some of these series don't have any different difference (i.e. the calculate difference in percentage is very close to zero).



#### Task 3 - Identifying periodicity

For this task we are interested in identifying common periods in the station swipe data to assess if there are periodic trends in the data (e.g. seasonal, monthly, yearly).

We identify the four most periodic stations, namely stations 0, 194, 150, 327.

I worked with Marium Sultan, Andrew Nell, Davey Ives, and some support from Sebastian Bana (previous year class) to undertake this assignment, mainly for Task 3. I completed task 1 by myself, and task 2 with support of Marium Sultan.
