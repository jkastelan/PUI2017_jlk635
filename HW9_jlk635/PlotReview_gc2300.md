The height, width and structure of face denote the total number of seven major felony offenses in each year.

The height and width of mouth denote the number of murder & NON-NEGL manslaugter.

The smiling denotes the number of rape.

The height and width of eyes denote the number of robbery.

The height and width of hair denote the number of felony assault.

The style of hair denotes the number of burglary.

The height and width of nose denote the number of grand larceny.

The width and height of ear denote the number of grand larceny of motor vehicle.

The data is retrieved from http://www1.nyc.gov/assets/nypd/downloads/excel/analysis_and_planning/seven-major-felony-offenses-2000-2016.xls.


#### The review comprises three parts:

   2. Aesthetics and selection of visual representation for information presentation
   3. Overall assessment (opinion)

## Clarity

The plot is an interesting representation of information - the seven major felony offenses in NYC for years 2000-2016. The plot shows each year represented by a different face, and features on the face represent a specific felony type for that given year.

There's a clear trend in the data across time. 2000 looks very strange and could be an outlier across all the offences. In general, longitudinal data (data varying across time) lends itself better to a **line chart** with time plotted on the x-axis.



## Aesthetics and selection of visual representation for information presentation

Chernoff faces create an emotional connection between the reader and data. Humans are very good at reading faces, because we spend our days doing this.. looking as faces and judging or recognising distinguishing features from them. We assess faces which look similar, and which look different, and we can see similarities in the faces which are a year or two apart in this example.

The legend also needs to be referred to, to determine what each of the attributes represent, and there isn't a natural connection between the face characteristics and what they represent (e.g. style of hair represents burglary - cool).

For the choice of colors, you may want to review under different color blindness scenarios and adjust as appropriate, as the face colors either show as varying shades of green, or varying shades of pink under the different scenarios. 

## Overall assessment (opinion)

Nice chart. Presents a unique representation of this information. You might consider transforming to a line chart.. although maybe not thought provoking or interesting like this visual is.

The plot presents the information accurately, although may be hard to interpret precisely, particularly with reference to the colors - it's not clear which color is large vs. small.

You might also improve the plot using a more visual legend such as the one presented here for the [Faces of Crime in the US](http://flowingdata.com/2010/08/31/how-to-visualize-data-with-cartoonish-faces/crime-chernoff-faces-by-state-edited-2/), or some basic changes to the legend which present **Attribute**: followed by **variable** (or vice-versa). 

e.g. **Style of hair:** number of burglaries

Also, you may want to remove additional words (such as *'the'*, *'height and width'*, *'denote'*) which create noise from what the reader is trying to determine by looking at the legend. A table format may also be suitable.



*I chose to do **Chernoff faces** for my plot also, so maybe I'm a biased big fan!* 

**WELL DONE!**
