# Homework 9

## Completed by #JKtours

### Assignment 1
For Assignment 1, I reviewed three (3) of my classmates plots as included in the folder. I completed this by myself.

### Assignment 2
For Assignment 2, I completed the notebook assessing broadband coverage across New York City, and the impact linkNYC stations are having on delivery of internet to those without coverage at home.

I learned how to compile choropleth, and scale the mappings for appropriate projections using geopandas. I also learned how to do a spatial join using shp files and groupby function to count the number of linkNYC stations by PUMA.

We used different approaches for the colour maps also to highlight important insights from the visualisations and reducing chart junk.

LAstly, I got to lean about the census, and supporting ACS datasets; and how to access them from the API.

For Assignment 2 I collaborated with a number of people including Andrew Nell, Alex Shannon, Anastasia S, Nick Jones, Ruben H and for a couple of the extra credit pieces Julian Ferreiro.
