### Assignment 1
Clustering of time series of number of establishments by zipcode over time.

I used three clustering approaches to understand trends and similarities in the time series:
 
 1. K-means clustering
 
 2. DBSCAN density base clustering
 
 3. Hierarchical agglomerative clustering 

Plotted all three of these clustering results on a choropleth of NYC, and compared the results between the clsutering techniques.

### Assignment 2
Complete the lab for k-means algorithm, and animate.


# Worksplit

I worked with Andrew Nell on Assignment 1, mainly on the data munging component. I completed Assignment 2 on my own.
